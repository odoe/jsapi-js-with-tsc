# Demo App

> TypeScript with the [ArcGIS API 4 for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/)

## Features

This demo highlights using TypeScript typings with vanilla JS to get intellisense and use TypeScript compiler to output JavaScript ESM to AMD to still use the ArcGIS JS CDN.

## Usage

1. Clone the repo and `npm install` dependencies
2. `npm run dev` to compile `/src/main.js` to `main.js` in the `app` folder and watch for changes
3. launch `index.html` in your browser of choice.
